in angular, an app consists of
* a set of components
* services that provide functionality across those components
    - services such as access data from a backend server, perfomgin tax calcs, or logging or exception handling

what is an angular component?
* each component has a template
    - a template is HTML defining a view for the application
        - everything we want to display to the user is defined in a template 
    - think of a template as your app's UI
* each component has a class
    - think of a component class as code behind your UI
        - class contains the properties or data elements available for binding to the view
        - methods which perform actions for the view, such as responding to a button click
* each component has metadata
    - provides additional information about the component to Angular
    - metadata is extra data about a component

putting all of this together:

a **component** has a **ui** defined with a **template**, associated **code** defined with a **class**, and additional information defined with **metadata**
