installing what we need: npm

npm
- node package manager

npm is two things
1. an online regisitry and repository of free and open-source projects and code
2. a CLI utility for interacting with that repository

node_modules
- the folder in which these packages we get are installed

npm has become the package manager for JS apps

allows us to install libraries, packages, and applications

npm executes scripts to perform tasks, such as running our application

we need to install npm, but not directly. we have to install node.js to do that. it includes npm.
