installing what we need: package.json

what else do we need?

we need the angular libraries that comprise the angular framework

angular CLI
- CLI for angular

typescript
- language we will use with Angular

testing tools, linters.ect.

we don't need to install these manually, at least not directly

package.json file
- lists each package we need for our angular application.

we use package.json file to tell npm what packages to install

package.json
